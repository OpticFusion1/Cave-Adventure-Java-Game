# Cave-Adventure-Java-Game
A small single-player Java text-based adventure game. Code by Jackson Oliva.

A dizzied awakening at a cave's entrance begins your adventure. What you do from there is up to you!
What path you should take, which doors you shall open, and what time you anger the fish (?) are all under your control!
Explore the confines of the cave to find something better (or far worse) on the other side...

Background music borrowed from Doom (1993) by ID Software.
Item-get sound effect taken without modification from freesound.org. 
All other art and sound effects are originally created by Jackson Oliva using Reaper and Photoshop.
